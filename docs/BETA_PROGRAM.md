### Understanding Signals

Each signal contains:

2. **Action**: BUY or SELL
3. **Entry Price**: Price to enter the trade
4. **Stop Loss**: Price to exit if trade goes against you
5. **Take Profit**: Target profit level
6. **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Potential profit vs. potential loss

### Acting on Signals
